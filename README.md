## Submission Instructions

After completing the test within 60 minutes:

### 1. Push Your Code
- Create a **new public GitHub repository**
- Push your complete solution including:
  - `backend/` folder (if you chose Backend or Full-Stack)
  - `frontend/` folder (if you chose Frontend or Full-Stack)
  - `README.md` (this file, optionally updated with setup instructions)

### 2. Complete SUBMISSION.md

- Start the meeting and begin screen sharing
- **Screen sharing must be of your entire screen** (not just a single window)
- Record the entire 60-minute session through MS Teams recording feature
- Ensure the recording captures:
  - Your full coding session
  - AI prompts used (visible in your IDE)
  - Code writing and testing process
  - Terminal output and browser testing
  - Verbal explanations of your approach

**Recording Guidelines:**
- Test your screen sharing and recording setup before starting
- Ensure audio isEnabled for verbal communication
- Keep camera On (optional but recommended)
- Recording will be stored in MS Teams and accessible to evaluators

### 4. Submit
Provide the following to your RM/TM:
- **GitHub repository URL**
- **MS Teams recording link** (will be available in the meeting chat after recording ends)
