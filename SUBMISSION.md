# Submission Summary

## Track Chosen
<!-- Mark your choice with [x] -->
- [ ] Backend Only
- [ ] Frontend Only
- [x] Full-Stack (Both)

## GitHub Copilot Usage Summary
<!-- Describe how you used AI throughout the test. Be specific about when and how you leveraged AI tools. -->

[We leveraged Copilot to create basic backend and frontend and through Github Copilot and I used Agent mode to do the things as instructed to AI and the model was Claude Sonet 4.5 with copilot-instruction.md file.]

## Key Prompts Used
<!-- List 3-5 important prompts you used with your AI assistant -->

1. [Example: "Consider yourself as a best fullstack developer and with that we need to create a fullstack app which hold a backend and frontend which are already available and in that we need to Build a Task Management Feature."]
2. [Example: "We need to refine the whole theme and it should look modern and there should be some wavy gradient running at background of app as like the PS3 starts and you can look for best as you are best designer too. We need to impress them with our skills and it should be great enough to be present in front of everyone."]
3. [Example: "Great I loved that, Now we need to go over backend and do some check and improvements"]
4. 
5. 

## Design Decisions (optional)
<!-- Explain key architectural or implementation decisions you made and why -->

- **Decision 1:** [e.g., "Used a singleton service for in-memory task storage"]
  - **Reasoning:** [e.g., "To maintain state consistency across API calls without a database"]

- **Decision 2:** [e.g., "Implemented reactive forms instead of template-driven"]
  - **Reasoning:** [e.g., "Better type safety and validation control"]

- **Decision 3:** 
  - **Reasoning:** 

## Challenges Faced
<!-- Optional: Describe any challenges encountered and how you overcame them -->

[On initial prompt which hold all potential to create backend and frontend, AI was making mistakes and then later try to resolve with some additional code which add extra load towards code and making that more complex.]
